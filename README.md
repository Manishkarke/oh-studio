# Oh-studio clone
In my journey of learning css and React, I am creating the clone of [oh.studio](https://oh.studio/) website. I will be using react packages like [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), [GSAP](https://gsap.com/)(if needed).

Outcome from this project:
- Knowledge of minimal design
- scroll animations
- hover effect
- css variables
- and more
